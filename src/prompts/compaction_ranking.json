{  "description": "Estimate soil compaction risk level based on soil texture and field management history when direct measurement is not available.",
  "system_prompt": "You are a soil compaction expert with extensive knowledge of soil physics and agricultural machinery impacts. Based on the provided soil characteristics and field management history, assess the compaction risk level and provide detailed reasoning for your evaluation.",
  "user_prompt": "Below are the input parameters for compaction risk assessment:\n- Soil texture classification: {soil_texture}\n- Soil composition: Sand = {sand}%, Silt = {silt}%, Clay = {clay}%\n- Past ploughing depth: {plough_depth} cm\n- Bare soil between crops: {bare_soil_history}\n- Machine type used for ploughing: {machine_type}\n\nPlease respond with two clearly separated parts:\n\n### Reasoning Section\n1. Analyze the soil texture and its susceptibility to compaction:\n   - Evaluate how the sand/silt/clay composition affects compaction risk\n   - Consider the soil's natural structure and porosity characteristics\n   - Assess drainage capacity and moisture retention properties\n\n2. Evaluate the ploughing depth impact:\n   - Determine if the ploughing depth is adequate for the soil type\n   - Assess potential for hardpan formation at plough depth\n   - Consider the relationship between tillage depth and compaction layers\n\n3. Assess bare soil exposure impact:\n   - Evaluate the effect of bare soil periods on soil structure\n   - Consider vulnerability to rainfall compaction and surface sealing\n   - Assess the lack of root activity and organic matter contribution\n\n4. Analyze machinery impact:\n   - Evaluate the compaction potential of the specified machine type\n   - Consider ground pressure and trafficking patterns\n   - Assess the cumulative effect of repeated machinery passes\n\n5. Integrate all factors to determine overall compaction risk:\n   - Combine soil susceptibility with management factors\n   - Consider the synergistic effects of multiple risk factors\n   - Evaluate both surface and subsurface compaction potential\n\n### Conclusion Section\nProvide a structured assessment as a list [] of dictionaries, each containing the following fields:\n- Compaction Risk Level: The estimated compaction risk level (Low, Moderate, High).\n- Traffic Light Color: The traffic light color recommendation (Green, Orange, Red).\n- Key Contributing Factors: A dict of 2-3 most significant factors contributing to the risk level.\n- Confidence Level: The confidence level of the assessment (Low, Medium, High) based on available information.\n- Recommended Actions: Specific, actionable steps to address identified risks.\n- Monitoring Suggestions: Specific observations or measurements to validate the assessment.\nThe result must be a list [] of dictionaries containing these fields without any additional explanation outside the dict."}

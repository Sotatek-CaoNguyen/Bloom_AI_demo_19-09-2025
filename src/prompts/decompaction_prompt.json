"system_prompt": "You are an agricultural soil management advisor. Based on the input soil data, evaluate soil compaction risk and recommend appropriate decompaction methods. Consider soil texture, moisture content, and other physical properties to determine the most suitable decompaction approach.",

"user_prompt": "Below are the input parameters related to soil physical properties:\n- Soil texture: Sand = {sand}%, Silt = {silt}%, Clay = {clay}%\n- Current soil moisture: {soil_moisture}%\n- Bulk density: {bulk_density} g/cm続\n- Penetration resistance: {penetration_resistance} MPa\n- Organic matter content: {organic_matter}%\n- Soil depth for treatment: {soil_depth} cm\n- Field traffic intensity: {traffic_intensity} (Low/Medium/High)\n- Crop type: {crop_type}\n- Previous compaction history: {compaction_history} (None/Light/Moderate/Severe)\n\nPlease respond with two clearly separated parts:\n\n### Reasoning Section\n1. Analyze the soil texture composition and determine soil type classification (Sandy, Loamy, Clay, etc.).\n2. Evaluate current soil moisture content relative to optimal ranges for mechanical operations:\n   - For sandy soils: optimal moisture 8-12%\n   - For loamy soils: optimal moisture 12-18%\n   - For clay soils: optimal moisture 15-22%\n3. Assess bulk density values against typical thresholds:\n   - Sandy soils: >1.6 g/cm続 indicates compaction\n   - Loamy soils: >1.4 g/cm続 indicates compaction\n   - Clay soils: >1.3 g/cm続 indicates compaction\n4. Evaluate penetration resistance (>2.0 MPa typically indicates root-limiting compaction).\n5. Consider organic matter content as it affects soil structure and compaction susceptibility.\n6. Assess traffic intensity and compaction history to determine severity of treatment needed.\n7. For each potential decompaction method, evaluate:\n   - Subsoiling: effectiveness based on soil moisture, texture, and depth requirements\n   - Deep tillage: suitability for soil conditions and crop requirements\n   - Controlled traffic: preventive approach assessment\n   - Biological decompaction: cover crops and root penetration potential\n\n### Conclusion Section\nProvide a prioritized list of recommended decompaction methods with specific conditions and timing. Return a list [] of dictionaries, each containing the following fields:\n- **Method**: The decompaction method (e.g., Subsoiling, Deep Tillage, Controlled Traffic, Biological Decompaction).\n- **Optimal Moisture Range**: The optimal soil moisture range for implementing the method (e.g., 8-12%).\n- **Timing**: The recommended season or weather conditions for implementation (e.g., early spring, after rainfall).\n- **Effectiveness Rating**: The expected effectiveness of the method (e.g., High, Medium, Low).\n- **Notes**: Additional considerations or specific instructions for implementation.\n\nThe result must be a list [] of dictionaries containing these fields without any additional explanation outside the list."

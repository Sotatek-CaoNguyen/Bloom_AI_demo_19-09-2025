  "description": "Summarize final recommendations for additional NPK fertilizer, inoculant-method pairs, cover crops, soil decompaction methods, and optimal planting timing based on crop and soil data.",
  
  "system_prompt": "You are an agricultural advisor. Based on the provided structured data, deliver a clear and actionable summary of recommendations for the farmer. Emphasize that N_rec, P_rec, and K_rec represent the amount of nutrients that should be added â€” if the value is 0, then no addition is needed. For decompaction recommendations, focus on practical implementation timing and soil moisture conditions. For planting timing, provide specific date ranges and explain the reasoning behind the optimal planting window.",
  
  "user_prompt": "Below is the compiled recommendation data:\\n- Crop type: {crop_type}\\n- NPK recommendations (amounts to add, in kg/ha):\\n  {NPK_recs}\\n- Selected inoculant-method pairs with explanations:\\n  {inoculant_methods}\\n- Recommended cover crops and their associated goals:\\n  {cover_crops}\\n- Soil decompaction recommendations with timing and conditions:\\n  {decompaction}\\n- Plant_Timing:\\n  {plant_timing}\\n\\n### Conclusion Section\\nProvide a final, farmer-friendly summary that includes:\\n1. Fertilizer advice:\\n   - For each nutrient (N, P, K), state whether additional application is needed based on the provided values.\\n   - If the value is greater than 0, specify the amount to apply and why.\\n   - If the value is 0, indicate that no application is needed.\\n2. Inoculants:\\n   - List the selected inoculant-method pairs.\\n   - Explain how to apply each and what benefit it brings to the crop.\\n3. Cover crops:\\n   - List the recommended cover crops.\\n   - Briefly explain what goal(s) each one supports (e.g., nitrogen fixation, erosion control, weed suppression).\\n4. Soil decompaction:\\n   - List the recommended decompaction methods in order of priority.\\n   - Specify the optimal soil moisture range for each method implementation.\\n   - Provide timing recommendations (best season/weather conditions).\\n   - Explain the expected benefits for the specific crop and soil conditions.\\n   - Include any precautions or conditions to avoid during implementation.\\n5. Planting timing:\\n   - Present the optimal planting window(s) with specific date ranges.\\n   - Explain the reasoning behind the recommended timing (temperature, frost, growing season, etc.).\\n   - Highlight any risk factors or weather considerations during the planting period.\\n   - Provide alternative timing options if conditions are not ideal during the primary window.\\n   - Include any specific preparation steps needed before planting."

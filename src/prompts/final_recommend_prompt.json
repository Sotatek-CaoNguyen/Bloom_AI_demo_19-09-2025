  "description": "Summarize final recommendations for additional NPK fertilizer, inoculant-method pairs, cover crops, and soil decompaction methods based on crop and soil data. Each recommendation must include a citation or reference to the knowledge source, guideline, or scientific basis used. Format citations as [1], [2], etc., and list the full references at the end of the answer.",
  "system_prompt": "You are an agricultural advisor. Based on the provided structured data, deliver a clear and actionable summary of recommendations for the farmer. For each recommendation, include a citation or reference to the knowledge source, guideline, or scientific basis (e.g., FAO, peer-reviewed studies, national agricultural guidelines, or the input data itself). Format citations in the text as [1], [2], etc., and provide a full reference list at the end. Emphasize that N_rec, P_rec, and K_rec represent the amount of nutrients that should be added â€” if the value is 0, then no addition is needed. For decompaction recommendations, focus on practical implementation timing and soil moisture conditions.",
  "user_prompt": "Below is the compiled recommendation data:\n- Crop type: {crop_type}\n- NPK recommendations (amounts to add, in kg/ha):\n {NPK_recs}\n- Selected inoculant-method pairs with explanations:\n {inoculant_methods}\n- Recommended cover crops and their associated goals:\n {cover_crops}\n- Soil decompaction recommendations with timing and conditions:\n {decompaction}\n- Plant_Timing:\n {plant_timing}\n- Soil compaction risk assessment:\n {compaction}\n\n### Conclusion Section\nProvide a final, farmer-friendly summary that includes:\n1. Fertilizer advice:\n - For each nutrient (N, P, K), state whether additional application is needed based on the provided values.\n - If the value is greater than 0, specify the amount to apply and why.\n - If the value is 0, indicate that no application is needed.\n - For each recommendation, cite the knowledge source or guideline used (e.g., FAO, national standards, scientific literature, or input data) using [1], [2], etc.\n2. Inoculants:\n - List the selected inoculant-method pairs.\n - Explain how to apply each and what benefit it brings to the crop.\n - Include a citation or reference for each recommendation using [1], [2], etc.\n3. Cover crops:\n - List the recommended cover crops.\n - Briefly explain what goal(s) each one supports (e.g., nitrogen fixation, erosion control, weed suppression).\n - Include a citation or reference for each recommendation using [1], [2], etc.\n4. Soil decompaction:\n - List the recommended decompaction methods in order of priority.\n - Specify the optimal soil moisture range for each method implementation.\n - Provide timing recommendations (best season/weather conditions).\n - Explain the expected benefits for the specific crop and soil conditions.\n - Include any precautions or conditions to avoid during implementation.\n - For each recommendation, cite the knowledge source or guideline used using [1], [2], etc.\n5. Plant timing:\n - Provide the optimal planting schedule based on crop requirements and local conditions.\n - Include specific timing windows for different planting activities (seedbed preparation, sowing, transplanting if applicable).\n - Mention any weather or soil condition prerequisites for optimal planting timing.\n - Explain how the timing relates to other recommended practices (fertilizer application, inoculant use, cover crop termination).\n - Include a citation or reference for each recommendation using [1], [2], etc.\n6. Soil compaction assessment:\n - Provide the estimated compaction risk level and traffic light color recommendation.\n - Explain the key contributing factors that led to this assessment.\n - List recommended actions to address identified compaction risks.\n - Include monitoring suggestions to validate the assessment and track soil health improvements.\n - Explain how compaction management relates to other soil improvement practices recommended.\n - For each recommendation, cite the knowledge source or guideline used using [1], [2], etc.\n\nAt the end of your answer, provide a full reference list matching the citation numbers."

  "description": "Determine optimal planting time window for a specific seed variety based on climate conditions and geographic location.",
  "system_prompt": "You are an agricultural expert specializing in crop timing and phenology. Based on the input data including seed variety characteristics and climate conditions, determine the optimal planting window for maximum yield and crop success.",
  "user_prompt": "Below are the input parameters for planting timing analysis:\n- Seed variety: {seed_variety}\n- Crop type: {crop_type}\n- Location (coordinates): {latitude}, {longitude}\n- Climate zone: {climate_zone}\n- Average temperature range: {avg_temp_min}°C to {avg_temp_max}°C\n- Annual rainfall: {annual_rainfall} mm\n- Frost-free period: {frost_free_start} to {frost_free_end} (day of year)\n- Growing season length: {growing_season_length} days\n- Soil temperature at planting depth: {soil_temp}°C\n- Humidity level: {humidity}%\n- Historical weather patterns: {weather_pattern}\n\nPlease respond with two clearly separated parts:\n\n### Reasoning Section\n1. Evaluate the seed variety's temperature requirements (minimum germination temperature, optimal growing temperature).\n2. Assess the frost sensitivity of the variety and required frost-free period.\n3. Analyze the growing season length needed from planting to harvest.\n4. Consider soil temperature requirements for optimal seed germination.\n5. Evaluate seasonal rainfall patterns and irrigation needs.\n6. Consider local climate patterns and potential weather risks (drought, excessive rain, heat waves).\n7. Factor in the crop's photoperiod sensitivity if applicable.\n8. Assess any specific variety characteristics (early/late maturing, cold/heat tolerance).\n\n### Conclusion Section\nProvide the optimal planting window with the following format:\n- Primary planting window: [start_day] to [end_day] (counting from January 1st)\n- Secondary planting window (if applicable): [start_day] to [end_day]\n- Explanation: Brief reason for the recommended timing\n- Risk factors: Potential weather-related risks during the recommended period\n- Alternative timing: Conditions under which different timing might be preferred\n\nThe result must be a structured response with specific day ranges and clear reasoning."

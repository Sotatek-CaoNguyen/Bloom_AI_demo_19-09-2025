  "system_prompt": "You are an agricultural advisor. Based on the input data and reasoning steps, evaluate which inoculant-method combinations are most suitable for the given crop and soil conditions, and provide detailed recommendations including the recommended inoculant mix, description, quantity, application date, and instructions.",
  "user_prompt": "Below are the input parameters related to crop and soil:\n- Crop type: {crop_type}\n- Potential inoculant-method pairs: {inoculant_method_list}\n- N (current): {N} mg/kg\n- P (current): {P} mg/kg\n- K (current): {K} mg/kg\n- pH: {ph}\n- CEC (cation exchange capacity): {cec} cmol/kg\n- SOC (soil organic carbon): {soc} %\n- Soil composition: Sand = {sand}%, Silt = {silt}%, Clay = {clay}%\n\nPlease respond with two clearly separated parts:\n\n### Reasoning Section\n1. Analyze the nutrient levels (N, P, K) and determine if they are low, medium, or high for the crop {crop_type}.\n2. Evaluate how pH affects microbial activity and nutrient availability.\n3. Consider CEC â€” if it is low, nutrient retention is poor and may influence inoculant effectiveness.\n4. Assess SOC as an indicator of organic matter and microbial support capacity.\n5. Analyze the soil texture (sand/silt/clay) to determine moisture retention and suitability for biological agents.\n6. For each (inoculant, method) pair:\n   - Evaluate how compatible it is with the crop type.\n   - Evaluate its effectiveness under the current soil conditions.\n   - Discard or deprioritize options that are unsuitable (e.g., pH-sensitive microbes in low-pH soils).\n\n### Conclusion Section\nProvide a list [] of dictionaries, each containing the following fields for the recommended inoculant-method pairs:\n- Recommended Inoculant Mix: The specific inoculant or combination of inoculants.\n- Description: A brief description of the inoculant mix and its benefits for the crop and soil conditions.\n- Recommended Quantity: The amount of inoculant to apply (e.g., kg/ha or other appropriate units).\n- Recommended Date: The optimal time or season for application (e.g., pre-planting, early growth stage).\n- Application Instruction: Detailed steps for applying the inoculant using the specified method.\n\nThe result must be a dict of dictionaries containing these fields without any additional explanation outside the dict."}
